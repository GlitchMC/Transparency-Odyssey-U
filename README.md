## Installation: 
The unpacked zips are for use with other mods. You will need to use karameru from the kuriimu family of tools in order to merge these files with your existing mods.


3DS Luma:
 - drag and drop the luma folder to your SD card root. 
 - you can delete the titleID folder for whichever version you do NOT have (EU is 10EB, NA is EC70)


Citra: 
 - navigate to the mods folder for your game installation (right click > go to mods location)
 - *within* the luma folder (from the patch download), find the romfs folder (doesn't matter under which TitleID, they are the same). Drag and drop to the mods directory.
