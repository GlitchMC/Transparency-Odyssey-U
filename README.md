# Transparency-Odyssey-U

A text patch for Etrian Odyssey Untold: The Millenium Girl, which alters text on skills, items, etc. in order to inform the player of important numbers and mechanics such as damage modifiers or the importance of certain player stats.

Also includes optional bug fixes for things such as Ecstasy doing less damage with 1 bind from levels 11-15 than 0 binds at levels 11-15.

Done:
 - All Player Skills text
 - Enemy Grimoire Skills text
 - Player Skill Bugfixes 
 - Item text
 - Shop equipment fixes
 - Shop equipment texts
 - Guild Food Effects text

ToDo:
 - explain diminishing returns somewhere???
 - Update skills to use data tags instead of manual number inputs like U2???
 - optimize skill texts to minimize text movement during skill level up
 - comb through and make sure all terminology is consistent through the game (and across other games???)

## Installation: 
The unpacked zips are for merging with other mods. You will need to use karameru from the kuriimu family of tools in order to merge these files with your existing mods. If you are only going to use this mod alone, you will download the packed version.


3DS-Luma:
 - Enable Luma Patching by booting the system while holding Select
 - drag and drop the luma folder to your SD card root
 - (optional) you can delete the titleID folder for whichever version you do NOT have (EU is 10EB, NA is EC70) to save ~325mb of disc space


Citra: 
 - navigate to the mods folder for your game installation (right click > go to mods location)
 - *within* the luma folder (from the patch download), find the romfs folder (doesn't matter under which TitleID, they are the same). Drag and drop to the mods directory.
