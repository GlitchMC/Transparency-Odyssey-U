# Transparency-Odyssey-U
Transparency Patch for EOU:TMG


Changes Skill descriptions, item descriptions, and adds *real* numbers to skills. Also informs the player of "hidden" mechanics such as the importance of certain stats.
Also includes optional bug fixes for things such as Ecstasy doing less damage with 1 bind from levels 11-15 than 0 binds at levels 11-15.
